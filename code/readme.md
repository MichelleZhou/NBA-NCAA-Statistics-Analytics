## Setting up the application

Because one of our datasets was found on Kaggle and wasn't compatible with the format of `retrieve_data.py`, we have hosted some of our datasets in this GitHub repository. They are available for download at the following address:
- `link to Players.csv`
- `link to Seasons_Stats.csv`
- `link to player_data.csv`

Once the datasets have all been downloaded, simply run the following files in the following order:
1. `db_setup.sql`
2. `load_data.py`
3. `application.py`
